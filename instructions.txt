 RANUI BONUS PLAN - README

ABOUT THE APP:
---------------
The Ranui Bonus Plan is a simple clothing allowance tracker designed
for the Ranui family. It helps manage and monitor how much each child—
Nikau, Hana, and Tia—spends on clothing throughout the year.

Each child gets a $300 allowance annually. If they have more than
$50 left at the end of the year, they earn a BONUS activity of their choice.

-----------

1. RUN THE APP
   - Open and run `start_menu.py`.

2. SELECT A CHILD
   - Choose from Nikau, Hana, or Tia using the dropdown menu.

3. ENTER CLOTHING EXPENSE
   - Type the amount spent in the input field.
   - Click "Deduct Amount" to subtract it from the child’s allowance.
